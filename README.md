# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Description

For this project given the outline of my On-the-job ticket, my main objectives is to:

	The focus here has been learn JavaScript programming principles and put into practice basic coding 
	structures such as arrays, conditional statements and being able to perform looping routines to establish 
	an engaging useful interactive user experiences. 

	To achieve this aim, an array of user data (company yearly accounts) was examined, then processed 
	via Java Scripting to present this data to user in a more meaningful, insightful manner. This allowed me 
	to fully explore all the coding structures and more required to produce such output.


## User Story

    With the above in mind, one of the main obstacles was determining the correct mathematical formulas 
		(calculations) to use in order to produce results from the data which was correct and accurate. To aid me in the process the given data was first ported to a spreadsheet were various different calculation methods trialed and tested.
    
    From there key information from the data was targeted to be used in the overall presentation output to the user. Different JavaScript coding techniques was decided upon depending based on the output required from the data.

    Of one the key challenges in this task was to figure out how to traverse an array, to enable one to calculate the differences between array elements and then storing that information for future use in additional calculations later. Another was determining from this new array produced how to establish the maximum and minimum values within the array elements.

		After some time and research, for loops and if (conditional) statements were used to establish something close to the required results.



## Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN A Dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Loss

	THEN Write JavaScript code to analyze the records 
	
	THEN Calculate the total of months in the dataset 
		 Calculate the Net Total of the Profit/Losses over the entire period 
		 Calculate the average changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period

		 Calculate the Greatest Increase in Profits
		 Calculate the Greatest Decrease in Profits

		 Display the analysis obtained from the code in the Console output
